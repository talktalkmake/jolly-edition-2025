Based on the research each client submits, Laura proposes her idea for the project in a formal concept. This covers the look and feel of the project in low-fidelity; the idea is clear, the all-important details are to follow.

              Laura offers a single package that can be customized to your
              individual needs upon request. (If you need a cocktail card but
              not a menu, no problem.) Clients interested in less than a full
              package will not be a good fit.

              embellishments, assembly, packaging, and shipping to you is
